   <b> <center>Indian Premier League(IPL) History</center><br>   </b> The Indian Premier League (IPL)(also known as the TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons) is a men's Twenty20 (T20) cricket league that is annually held in India and contested by ten city-based franchise teams.[3][4] The BCCI founded the league in 2007. The competition is usually held between March and May every year, and has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme; fewer international cricket tours take place during IPL seasons.[5]

        The IPL is the most-popular cricket league in the world; in 2014, it was ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues.[6] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be broadcast live on YouTube.[7][8] The brand value of the IPL in 2022 was ₹90,038 crore (US$11 billion).[9] According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to the GDP of the economy of India.[10] In December 2022, the IPL became a decacorn valued at US$10.9 billion, registering a 75% growth in dollar terms since 2020 when it was valued at $6.2 billion, according to a report by consulting firm D & P Advisory.[11] The league has banned players from Pakistan since 2008, the previous and only time they appeared in the IPL.[12]
        
        As of 2023, there have been fifteen seasons of the tournament. The current title holders are the Gujarat Titans, who won the 2022 contest by defeating Rajasthan Royals in the final.

The Indian Cricket League (ICL) was founded in 2007 with funding provided by Zee Entertainment Enterprises.[13] The ICL was not recognised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the BCCI was not pleased with its committee members joining the ICL executive board.[14] To prevent players from joining the ICL, the BCCI increased the prize money in its domestic tournaments and imposed lifetime bans on players joining the ICL, which the BCCI considered a rebel league.[15][16]  <br>

BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi, who led the IPL effort, gave details of the tournament including its format, prize money, franchise revenue system and squad composition rules. It was also announced the IPL would be run by a seven-man governing council composed of former India players and BCCI officials, and that the two top IPL teams would qualify for that year's Champions League Twenty20. Modi also said the BCCI had been working on the idea for two years, and that the IPL was not started as a "knee-jerk reaction" to the ICL.[17] The league's format was similar to that of the English Premier League and the National Basketball Association in the United States.[16] According to Modi: "The IPL has been designed to entice an entire new generation of sports fans into the grounds throughout the country. The dynamic Twenty20 format has been designed to attract a young fan base, which also includes women and children."[17]
